# Seed-Labs

Labs Included
âœ… Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Lab
Explored stored and self-propagating XSS attacks using the Elgg platform.

Injected JavaScript payloads to steal cookies, hijack sessions, forge HTTP requests, and write XSS worms.

Learned to implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to defend against XSS in production environments.

âœ… Environment Variable and Set-UID Program Lab
Investigated how environment variables influence behavior of Set-UID programs.

Demonstrated attacks using manipulated PATH, LD_PRELOAD, and system() calls.

Analyzed privilege escalation techniques and secure alternatives like execve().

âœ… Format String Vulnerability Lab
Exploited vulnerable printf() functions to:

Leak memory content.

Modify variable values.

Inject and execute shellcode for root access.

Constructed reverse shell payloads and studied stack manipulation techniques.

âœ… Return-to-libc Attack Lab
Bypassed non-executable stack protections using return-to-libc techniques.

Used GDB to extract libc addresses and frame pointers.

Crafted exploits to execute system("/bin/sh") and escalate to root shell access.

âœ… Risk Management Assessment
Applied the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology to evaluate outdated software (Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader).

Recommended upgrade strategies based on cost, vulnerability severity, and exploitability.

Learned structured risk analysis and how to justify decisions to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
Practical exploitation techniques for XSS, buffer overflows, format string bugs, and privilege escalation.

Reverse engineering with tools like GDB, Netcat, and Docker.

Secure software practices: input validation, privilege dropping, and system call hardening.

Implementing defenses like CSP, non-executable stacks, and secure coding in C.

Using OWASP risk models to guide business-driven security decisions.

ðŸŒŸ How I Can Impact Your Company
With my deep, hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating real-world vulnerabilities, I bring a security-first mindset to development, DevOps, and security engineering teams. I can:

Proactively identify and resolve vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Conduct security assessments and implement secure coding practices.

Build tools and automation to monitor, detect, and respond to attacks.

Translate technical risk into business impact, helping leadership make informed decisions.

Strengthen application and infrastructure security in cloud, containerized, and on-premise environments.
